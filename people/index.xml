Her goal is to understand how signaling and transcriptional heterogeneity control viral phenotypes when coupled to feedback control. Her interests include systems biology, computational modeling, and synthetic biological circuits. Elise is a member of the Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology and is supported by the program’s NIH T32 training grant. She received her Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/endah-sulistijo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/endah-sulistijo/</guid><description>Endah got her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Rice University. She is currently involved to two research projects: (1) Characterization of protein phosphorylation signatures in latent HIV-infected cells and non-infected cells, and (2) Optimization of microfluidic techniques for detection of cell signaling proteins at single-cell level.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/gaby-pizzurro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/gaby-pizzurro/</guid><description>Gaby studies macrophage heterogeneity in the melanoma tumor microenvironment. She developed in vitro 3D co-cultures to explore how fibroblasts and tumor cells shape the functional phenotypes of macrophages in the early stages of tumor development. She is also exploring how the timing of treatment with agonistic CD40 in the preclinical melanoma model alters myeloid cell states and their interactions with other cell types and myeloid subsets in the TME. Gaby received her PhD in Biological Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/ilana-kelsey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/ilana-kelsey/</guid><description>Ilana is interested in the polarization process of macrophages, specifically how individual cells activate and regulate their polarization responses when they encounter complex or conflicting cues from the environment. Using live-cell microscopy and flow cytometry, she is investigating the signaling events, gene transcription, and protein production of various polarization pathways to elucidate the plasticity and mechanism of polarization decisions in complex environments, such as might be encountered in the tumor microenvironment.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/kate-bridges/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/kate-bridges/</guid><description>Kate is studying immune cell heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment through computational analysis of single-cell data sets.
