Her goal is to understand how signaling and transcriptional heterogeneity control viral phenotypes when coupled to feedback control. Her interests include systems biology, computational modeling, and synthetic biological circuits. Elise is a member of the Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology and is supported by the program’s NIH T32 training grant. She received her Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/endah-sulistijo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/endah-sulistijo/</guid><description>Endah got her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Rice University. She is currently involved to two research projects: (1) Characterization of protein phosphorylation signatures in latent HIV-infected cells and non-infected cells, and (2) Optimization of microfluidic techniques for detection of cell signaling proteins at single-cell level.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/ilana-kelsey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/ilana-kelsey/</guid><description>Ilana is interested in the polarization process of macrophages, specifically how individual cells activate and regulate their polarization responses when they encounter complex or conflicting cues from the environment. Using live-cell microscopy and flow cytometry, she is investigating the signaling events, gene transcription, and protein production of various polarization pathways to elucidate the plasticity and mechanism of polarization decisions in complex environments, such as might be encountered in the tumor microenvironment.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/laura-kellman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/laura-kellman/</guid><description>Laura is studying the role of p38 kinase signaling in the regulation of IL-6 following TLR stimulation. She uses both single-cell and cell-population approaches to understand how intercellular signaling heterogeneity translates to variability in cytokine secretion. Laura received her Bachelor’s degree in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology from Yale University.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/linda-fong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/linda-fong/</guid><description>Linda&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on the temporal dynamics of phosphoproteins in the reactivation of latent HIV. Through systems analysis and multivariate regression modeling, her work aims to elucidate key signaling pathways which can predict network responses to pharmacologic intervention. Her research interests involve using data-driven models of cell signaling to approach problems in oncology and infectious diseases. Linda earned her BS from MIT in Biological Engineering (Course XX) with a minor in Science, Technology, and Society and a concentration in Ethics.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/markus-eisele/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/markus-eisele/</guid><description>Markus is studying the different behavior of single cells under LPS stress compared to cells in a population. He is using computational modeling and systems analysis to explore TLR4 signaling. Markus is a Master’s student in Stuttgart, Germany and is visiting Yale University for one year.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/qiong-xue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/qiong-xue/</guid><description>Qiong joined the Miller-Jensen lab from Texas A&amp;amp;M with a background in inflammation and infectious diseases. She is investigating cytokine/chemokine secretion signatures of both a cell population and single cells and excited to apply systems analysis to single cell inflammatory responses.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/ramesh-ramji/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/ramesh-ramji/</guid><description>Ramesh likes to invent novel integrated micro analytical devices for biological applications. With a PhD in bioengineering (microfluidic cell based assays) from the National University of Singapore (NUS), he dwells into areas including nanobiotechnology, bioimaging, analytical chemistry and instrumentation. He is currently developing a high throughput multiplexed microfluidic device to quantify signaling dynamics and endpoint protein secretion at the &amp;ldquo;single cell&amp;rdquo; level.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/victor-bass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/victor-bass/</guid><description>Victor received his PhD in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology in 2020.
