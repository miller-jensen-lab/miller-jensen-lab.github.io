She developed in vitro 3D co-cultures to explore how fibroblasts and tumor cells shape the functional phenotypes of macrophages in the early stages of tumor development. She is also exploring how the timing of treatment with agonistic CD40 in the preclinical melanoma model alters myeloid cell states and their interactions with other cell types and myeloid subsets in the TME. Gaby received her PhD in Biological Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/ilana-kelsey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/ilana-kelsey/</guid><description>Ilana was a postdoctoral associate who studied how individual macrophages activate and regulate their polarization responses when they encounter complex or conflicting cues from the environment. She is now a Technical Specialist at Finnegan LLP.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/isaiah-yim/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/isaiah-yim/</guid><description>Isaiah is using synthetic molecular approach to study the role of TNF paracrine signaling cytokine in propagating the pro-inflammatory signal as well as triggering the anti-inflammatory response via IL-10 signaling. He is interested in how these extracellular networks generate spatial patterns of inflammation that might be important in tissue microenvironments requiring local control, such as the brain. Isaiah received his B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Michigan.</description></item><item><title/><link>/people/iyad-issa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/iyad-issa/</guid><description>Iyad is studying the transcriptional networks that regulate macrophage heterogeneity.
