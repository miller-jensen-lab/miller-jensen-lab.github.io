<h4>Amanda Alexander</h4>
<span class=position>Graduate Student (Biomedical Engineering)</span>
<p>Amanda is investigating spatial and temporal regulation of cell-to-cell
heterogeneity in the inflammatory response in macrophages. She is interested in
how dysregulation of intercellular heterogeneity in inflammation may contribute
to autoimmune diseases. Amanda is supported by an NSF Graduate Research
Fellowship. She received her Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Spelman
College with additional coursework in Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia
Institute of Technology.</p>

<h4>Andrés Muñoz Rojas</h4>
<span class=position>Graduate Student (Biomedical Engineering)</span>
<p>Andrés is investigating the paradoxical role of macrophages in promoting and
destroying tumors. Using a novel microfluidic device, he is studying the
signaling dynamics of single macrophages and correlating it to downstream
protein secretion signatures in the same single cell. His interests include
cancer immunology, microscopy, systems biology and signal transduction. Andrés
received his Bachelor’s degree in Bioengineering from the University of
Pennsylvania with a minor in Music.</p>

<h4>Elise Bullock</h4>
<span class=position>Graduate Student (Biomedical Engineering)</span>
<p>Elise studies signaling and transcriptional regulation of HIV latency using
computational and experimental approaches. Her goal is to understand how
signaling and transcriptional heterogeneity control viral phenotypes when
coupled to feedback control. Her interests include systems biology,
computational modeling, and synthetic biological circuits. Elise is a member of
the Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology and is
supported by the program’s NIH T32 training grant. She received her Bachelor’s
degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>

<img src=../img/people/ilana-kelsey.jpg class=small-shadow>
<h4>Ilana Kelsey</h4>
<span class=position>Postdoctoral Associate</span>
<p>Ilana is interested in the polarization process of macrophages, specifically
how individual cells activate and regulate their polarization responses when
they encounter complex or conflicting cues from the environment. Using
live-cell microscopy and flow cytometry, she is investigating the signaling
events, gene transcription, and protein production of various polarization
pathways to elucidate the plasticity and mechanism of polarization decisions in
complex environments, such as might be encountered in the tumor
microenvironment. Ilana received her Ph.D. from Harvard University, where she
studied the regulation of the proto-oncogene PIM3 by mTORC1 in Brendan
Manning’s lab. She received Bachelor’s degrees in Biochemistry and Biology at
the University of Maryland.</p>

<img src=../img/people/laura-kellman.jpg class=small-shadow>
<h4>Laura Kellman</h4>
<span class=position>Post-baccalaureate Researcher</span>
<p>Laura is studying the role of p38 kinase signaling in the regulation of IL-6
following TLR stimulation. She uses both single-cell and cell-population
approaches to understand how intercellular signaling heterogeneity translates
to variability in cytokine secretion. Laura received her Bachelor’s degree in
Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology from Yale University.</p>

<img src=../img/people/victor-bass.jpg class=small-shadow>
<h4>Victor Bass</h4>
<span class=position>Graduate Student (Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology)</span>
<p>Victor studies how single cell heterogeneity in NF-kB dynamics affects
transcription of inflammatory genes in different chromatin environments. He
uses a combination of live-cell imaging and single molecule fluorescence in
situ hybridization to measure NF-κB dynamics and quantify transcript output in
the same single cells. His research interests include single-cell
heterogeneity, signal transduction, and fluorescence microscopy. He received
his Bachelor&rsquo;s in Biological Sciences from Carnegie Mellon University with a
minor in Chemistry.</p>

<h4>Arvind Chavali</h4>
<span class=position>Postdoctoral Associate</span>
<p>Arvind is investigating the role of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the
activation of latent HIV proviruses. His interests lie in computational
modeling and systems analysis. Arvind received his PhD in biomedical
engineering from the University of Virginia.</p>

<h4>Endah Sulistijo</h4>
<span class=position>Postdoctoral Associate (joint with Prof. Rong Fan)</span>
<p>Endah got her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Rice University. She is currently
involved to two research projects: (1) Characterization of protein
phosphorylation signatures in latent HIV-infected cells and non-infected cells,
and (2) Optimization of microfluidic techniques for detection of cell signaling
proteins at single-cell level.</p>

<h4>Linda Fong</h4>
<span class=position>Graduate Student (Biomedical Engineering)</span>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s research focuses on the temporal dynamics of phosphoproteins in the
reactivation of latent HIV. Through systems analysis and multivariate
regression modeling, her work aims to elucidate key signaling pathways which
can predict network responses to pharmacologic intervention. Her research
interests involve using data-driven models of cell signaling to approach
problems in oncology and infectious diseases. Linda earned her BS from MIT in
Biological Engineering (Course XX) with a minor in Science, Technology, and
Society and a concentration in Ethics.</p>
