<h4>Elise Bullock</h4>
<span class=position>Graduate Student (Biomedical Engineering)</span>
<p>Elise studies signaling and transcriptional regulation of HIV latency using
computational and experimental approaches. Her goal is to understand how
signaling and transcriptional heterogeneity control viral phenotypes when
coupled to feedback control. Her interests include systems biology,
computational modeling, and synthetic biological circuits. Elise is a member of
the Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology and is
supported by the program’s NIH T32 training grant. She received her Bachelor’s
degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>

<h4>Erick Salvador Rocha</h4>
<span class=position>Graduate Student (Microbiology)</span>
<p>Erick is interested in the role of cell-to-cell variability in modulating
combinatorial innate immune responses. Specifically, he is interested in the
role of cell-to-cell communication in establishing adequate macrophage
inflammatory responses during bacterial infections. Outside of lab Erick
enjoys exploring the local coffee shops and the food scene of New Haven.
Erick received his B.S. in Biological Sciences from Cornell University.</p>

<h4>Gaby Pizzurro</h4>
<span class=position>Postdoctoral Associate</span>
<p>Gaby studies macrophage heterogeneity in the melanoma tumor microenvironment.
She developed in vitro 3D co-cultures to explore how fibroblasts and tumor cells
shape the functional phenotypes of macrophages in the early stages of tumor
development. She is also exploring how the timing of treatment with agonistic CD40
in the preclinical melanoma model alters myeloid cell states and their interactions
with other cell types and myeloid subsets in the TME. Gaby received her PhD in
Biological Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires.</p>

<img src=../img/people/ilana-kelsey.jpg class=small-shadow>
<h4>Ilana Kelsey</h4>
<span class=position>Postdoctoral Associate</span>
<p>Ilana is interested in the polarization process of macrophages, specifically
how individual cells activate and regulate their polarization responses when
they encounter complex or conflicting cues from the environment. Using
live-cell microscopy and flow cytometry, she is investigating the signaling
events, gene transcription, and protein production of various polarization
pathways to elucidate the plasticity and mechanism of polarization decisions in
complex environments, such as might be encountered in the tumor
microenvironment. Ilana received her Ph.D. from Harvard University, where she
studied the regulation of the proto-oncogene PIM3 by mTORC1 in Brendan
Manning’s lab. She received Bachelor’s degrees in Biochemistry and Biology at
the University of Maryland.</p>
