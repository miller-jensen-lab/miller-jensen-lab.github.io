Award</a>
for our group&rsquo;s project, &ldquo;Reverse Engineering the Inflammatory Signaling
Network from Single-Cell Data.&rdquo; The award provides $500,000 in funding to
researchers who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars. The CAREER Award is the
NSF’s most prestigious award for junior faculty.</p><p>This project examines why genetically identical macrophages — the first
responders in the immune system — vary in how strongly they respond to the
presence of pathogens by secreting pro-inflammatory &ldquo;danger signals.&rdquo; Using
state-of-the-art experimental tools for single-cell analysis, our group is
identifying the sources of heterogeneity from transcription to secretion of
proteins used for intracellular communication. These experiments are used to
fit a mathematical model of signaling, cytokine secretion, and diffusion fit to
single-cell data so that we can make predictions about emergent population
behavior.</p></article><article><h4><a name=kathryn-featured-in-fusion>Kathryn featured in Fusion "genius" segment</a>
